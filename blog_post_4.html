			<h2>Interview with Pavel Bárta about the last game</h2>
				<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Hello, thank you very much for taking the time to talk to us, Mr. Bárta. </br> </br>

<strong>Bárta:</strong> Hello, thank you for the invitation. </br> </br>

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Could you please tell us what happened in the last game your team lost 0-2? </br> </br>

<strong>Bárta:</strong> Unfortunately, several people from our team got sick and due to the absence of a substitute, we were forced to lose the last game of the group by default. It was a difficult situation for us because we were ready to fight and give our best. </br> </br>

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> That must be sad news for your fans. However, your team is still in the playoffs thanks to two previous wins. How do you feel about that? </br> </br>

<strong>Bárta:</strong> Yeah, you are right. It's a big shame. But like you said, we made it to the playoffs thanks to our previous successes. Despite this loss, our previous wins gave us confidence and showed that we have what it takes to go far. Our focus now is to get healthy and be ready for the next games. </br> </br>

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> What can we expect from your team in the playoffs? </br> </br>

<strong>Bárta:</strong> You can expect us to give our best in every game. The illness has weakened us, but it hasn't stopped us and we are determined to find our lost strength and show our abilities. We will fight at all costs and we believe we can achieve great results because this is just the beginning. </br> </br>

<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Thank you for the interview and good luck in the playoffs! </br> </br>

<strong>Bárta:</strong> Thank you for inviting us and we appreciate your support. We will try not to disappoint our fans. </br> </br>
