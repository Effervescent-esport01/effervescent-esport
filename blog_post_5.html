			<h2>Interview with Marian Zajíc about the last match</h2>
				<p><strong>Interviewer:</strong> Hello, thanks for taking the time for this interview. </br> </br>

		<strong>Zajíc:</strong> Hi, thanks for the invitation. </br> </br>

		<strong>Interviewer:</strong> How would you rate your performance in the last game, which you won 2-0 for your organization Effervescent? </br> </br>

		<strong>Zajíc:</strong> I am very proud of my performance. Despite a few mistakes, I managed to beat my opponent completely, even with a clean record. </br> </br>

		<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Your victory in the last match secured you the first place in the group. What does this mean to you? </br> </br>

		<strong>Zajíc:</strong> Placing first in the group is a tremendous accomplishment for our entire organization. It shows that our hard work is starting to pay off. It gives me a lot of confidence going into the playoffs. </br> </br>

		<strong>Interviewer:</strong> What can we expect from you in the playoffs? </br> </br>

		<strong>Zajíc:</strong> In the playoffs I want to continue this winning streak. Together with my teammate Jana, who unfortunately has the flu like many other players, we will train and improve our game. Every game in the playoffs will be tough, but I think we have what it takes to go far. Our goal is to win the whole tournament. </br> </br>

		<strong>Interviewer:</strong> How are you preparing for the upcoming playoff games? </br> </br>

		<strong>Zajíc:</strong> We will analyze our previous games and look for areas where we can improve. We will also study our potential opponents carefully and prepare specific strategies for each of them. The key will be to maintain our speed and focus. We will also focus on physical and mental fitness to ensure that each player is at their best. </br> </br>

		<strong>Interviewer:</strong> Thank you for the interview and good luck in the playoffs! </br> </br>

		<strong>Zajíc:</strong> Thanks and thanks to all our fans for their support. We will try to get the best results possible!
