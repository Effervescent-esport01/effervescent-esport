			<h2>Valorant Results Announcement</h2>
				<p><strong>Greetings to our loyal fans!</strong> </br> </br>
					We're really sorry to have to tell you that, due to illness, several of our players were unable to play in our last match in our regular group.
					We're really sorry to say that this has unfortunately meant we've been relegated to second place in the group. </br> </br>
					<strong>But don't despair!</strong> </br> </br>
					We're really sorry to have to tell you that we lost the match, but we've got some great news! We're through to the playoffs! 
					That means you can look forward to more exciting games for our team in the coming weeks. And we promise you that this time we won't let illness get the better of us.
					We'll show you the best game we can play! </br> </br>
					Thank you for your continued support and loyalty. We believe that the next game will culminate in our victory! </br> </br>
					Sincerely, your players and team
