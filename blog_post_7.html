				<p>We would like to announce that we have decided to end our cooperation with Pavel Bárta. This decision was made after a thorough evaluation of his contribution to the team and our future goals. </br></br>
While we have the utmost respect for Pavel's reliability, regular attendance at practice and games, and his team approach, we have unfortunately come to the conclusion that some key aspects of his performance, particularly his perception and mental toughness, do not meet the current demands of our competitive level.
This was not an easy decision to make as we recognize his commitment and dedication. However, it is important that our team maintains the high level of performance necessary to succeed in the competitive arena. </br></br>
We thank Pavel Bárta for his contribution and wish him every success in his future career. We are confident that his dedication and hard work will help him develop in other areas of his choice. </br></br>
This decision means that we will need to add a new face to our roster to take over his role in the team. We will be interviewing several potential candidates for this position in the coming weeks and you will soon see who will be replacing Pavel.
